# LaSalle Software Serverless' Render Laravel Blade Templates in Lambda Package

Render a Laravel Blade template without by using just Illuminate's view package. 

## With Deepest Appreciation

Thank you to Matt Stauffer, and to all contributors, for his Torch repository. 

[https://github.com/mattstauffer/Torch](https://github.com/mattstauffer/Torch)

My repo is adapted from Torch's view component. 

Thank you, Matt, for deciding to [assign Torch the MIT Licence](https://github.com/mattstauffer/Torch/commit/7ec886ad0505cab1d4d5bfdbce1988c4525d818f) a mere month before I needed to mess with it (in April 2021)!
