# LaSalle Software Serverless' Render Laravel Blade Templates in Lambda Package

Render Laravel Blade templates in AWS Lambda without launching an entire Laravel Application.


## With Deepest Appreciation

Thank you to Matt Stauffer, and to all contributors, for his Torch repository. 

[https://github.com/mattstauffer/Torch](https://github.com/mattstauffer/Torch)

My repo is clearly based on Torch's view component. 

Given:
- the design of Torch
- my very narrow interest in just Matt's view component
- my even more narrow interest in rendering a single Blade template in AWS Lambda

The following does not make sense:
- forking Torch
- submitting a PR

Matt does not need me severely mangling up his fabulous repository for the sake of my narrow interests. 

Thank you, Matt, for deciding to [assign Torch the MIT Licence](https://github.com/mattstauffer/Torch/commit/7ec886ad0505cab1d4d5bfdbce1988c4525d818f) a mere month ago (in April 2021)!
